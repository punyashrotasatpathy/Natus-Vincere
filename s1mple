# SEND CODE CRAZIER THAN THESE LYRICS
# Catch me in my Mercedes
#Bumpin' "Ice, Ice Baby, " screamin' Shady 'til I die
#Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
#So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
#And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
#Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Damn)
#Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
#And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
#Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick (My penis in your anus!)
#You morons think that I'm a genius
#Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
#Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
#And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark
#Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
#'Cause I'm'onna rip this mystical slick shit
#You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
#'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
#I'ma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'ma live this
